Pagination Filter - Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project 2
_________________________________________________________________________
Goal: Given a page full of students and their information, set up a filter that creates appropriate pagination so that only the first ten appear when the page loads and the correct number of pages are listed underneath,depending upon how many students are used.

Extra Credit: 
	1. Add a search bar that only shows students according to the search.
	2. If none are returned, make sure there is a message saying so.
	3. The search bar should also return ten entries at a time with correct pagination (still in progress).
